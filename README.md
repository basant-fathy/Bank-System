## 📖 About This Repository
This repository contains multiple versions of a **Bank System**, developed step by step to enhance my programming skills. Each version introduces new concepts and improvements:

1. **Bank System (Procedural)** – Basic operations using procedural programming.
2. **Bank System Extension** – Added file handling and better data management.
3. **Bank System Extension 2** – Further improvements and additional features.

All these projects are part of my **programming learning journey**, where I practice C++ concepts, file handling, and modular code design.

## 🎯 Learning Journey Context

This repository is part of my broader **Programming Learning Journey** documented on GitHub under the platform **Programming Advices**. Through these projects, I aim to:

- Practice C++ fundamentals.
- Apply file handling and data management concepts.
- Learn modular and organized coding practices.
- Prepare for more advanced OOP-based systems in the future.

## 💡 Why Explore These Projects?

These projects are snapshots of my learning steps. Each version shows how I solved problems, improved my code, and experimented with new ideas. It's less about the final product and more about **growing as a programmer** and documenting every milestone.
